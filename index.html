I'm still working on the design, but I'm thinking something like <a href="https://smallpdf.com">this</a>. We can use fun little icons for each page like a settings gear for Utilities and an open book for Dictionary, and then in between the title of the page and the icons, we can put a slideshow of pictures from Gambell.
<p>
Also I'd like to redesign the Utilities and Dictionary pages, too. They seem a little "cold" and out of date...I'll look around for more modern designs, and maybe we can jazz it up a bit. Honestly, I think something as simple as rounding the corners of all the div sections would help tremendously. Also, we'll need to include a navigation menu to the rest of the site.
